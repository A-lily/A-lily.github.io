I am a MSc student at the [African Masters of Machine Intelligence](thttps://aimsammi.org/){:target="_blank"}, an intensive masters sponsored by Google and Facebook. I obtained my Engineering degree in Computer Science from [Polytechnic School](https://esp.sn/){:target="_blank"} in 2021. My interests are in:

  Computer Vision 

  Natural Language Processing

  Deep Learning 

 I am now working on my final project in the field of healthcare using Multi-Modal Methods Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing technique like handwriting OCR (optical character recognition) based on medical records. However, there are a lot of challenges in handwriting OCR and more to be done in OCR in general addin the fact that I am working with raw data.
